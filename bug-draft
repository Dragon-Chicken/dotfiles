Stack windows extending off-screen


The stack window is extending off-screen.
I *have* modified the code but didn't touch the code that is causing this.

# how to reproduce
1. hold down `stack_increase` key bind (mod + ctrl + l)
2. eventually it will go off-screen
3. hold down `stack_decrease` key bind (mod + ctrl h)
4. it will resize till it's the normal height
